I. List of Supporting Files: These supporting files are sourced in the main files that reproduce the numbers in the submitted manuscript and supporting information.
1. functions_calc_ss.R = function to calculate the predicted number of clusters to get at least pre-specified power under a cluster randomized crossover (CRXO) design;
2. functions_gendata.R = function to generate the data;
3. functions_empirical.R = function to compute the empirical power or empirical type I error;
4. functions_calc_power.R = function to calculate the predicted power given number of clusters and mean/CV of cluster-period size;
